Business Systems Analysis 

## Group Assignment Proposal 
We choose the Career and Development module and decided to create a job portal prototype. The proposal is written to seek approval by the project manager. The proposal consists of: 
- Problems identified (why this job portal is needed) 
- Use case model 
- Functions outline 
- Visual preview 

We got the approval and went on to design a prototype in adobe XD. 

## Adobe XD 
- We have designed a mobile and desktop GUI of our main use cases 
- It can be a bit difficult to navigate as there are many artboards however, a demonstration can be seen in the final deliverable. 

## Final Deliverable 
The final deliverable consists of: 
- System architecture 
- Prototype Documentation with functionalities, data outline, demonstration and test plan for each Use Case. 
- Description of design principles (using Microsoft's user centred design principles) present in our prototype
